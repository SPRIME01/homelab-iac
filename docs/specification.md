Excellent please provide a specification for the homelab that includes all that following best
practices
Below is a comprehensive specification for your homelab environment. This specification is
designed to follow current best practices for modularity, scalability, security, and automation.

## 1. Overview

The homelab is designed as a resilient, secure, and scalable distributed computing
environment. It leverages container orchestration (via a lightweight k3s cluster),
infrastructure as code (IaC) with Pulumi, and automated configuration management with
Ansible. The system efficiently integrates specialized hardware for general services, AI/ML
workloads, home automation, and monitoring while ensuring redundancy and automated
recovery for critical components such as DNS.

## 2. Hardware Components

**Primary Control Node**

*   **Device:** Beelink SEi8 (Windows 11 Pro)
*   **Key Roles and Configuration:**
    *   **Container Orchestration:**
        *   Runs a WSL2 (Ubuntu) instance hosting the k3s control plane.
        *   Uses Flannel as the Container Network Interface (CNI).
    *   **Infrastructure & Automation Tools:**
        *   **Pulumi:** Defines Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingresses) and deploys Helm charts (e.g., Traefik).
        *   **Ansible:** Automates installation, configuration, patching, and ensures repeatable deployments across nodes.
    *   **Core Services Hosted:**
        *   **Ingress Controller:** Traefik (configured via NodePort and optionally LoadBalancer with metallb).
        *   **Authentication & Secrets:** Authelia for MFA and VaultWarden for storing secrets.
        *   **Messaging & Logging:** RabbitMQ for messaging; Loki (with promtail) for centralized log aggregation.
        *   **Additional Services:** Several databases (e.g., DuckDB, MongoDB, Qdrant), a remote desktop gateway (Guacamole), and a dashboard (Heimdall).

**AI/ML Node**

*   **Device:** Jetson AGX Orin
*   **Key Roles and Configuration:**
    *   **Dedicated GPU Workload:**
        *   Serves as a k3s worker node using an Ansible-based installation.
        *   Runs GPU-intensive workloads including NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (via Pulumi) and Ray worker nodes for distributed computing.
    *   **Software Components:**
        *   JetPack: Version 6.x or later (includes CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT).
        *   **Logging & Remote Access:** Promtail sends logs to the centralized Loki instance; TigerVNC (or similar) provides remote GUI access.
    *   **Object Storage:** MinIO runs for data and artifact storage.

**Home Automation Hub**

*   **Key Roles and Configuration:**
    *   **Automation and IoT Integration:**
        *   Runs Home Assistant OS (HAOS) typically on a Raspberry Pi.
        *   Integrates with the central broker via MQTT.
        *   Uses Mosquitto add-on for Zigbee2MQTT communication.
    *   **Optional Logging and Metrics:**
        *   Can forward logs to Loki (using promtail) and data to InfluxDB for time-series analysis.

**Monitoring Device**

*   **Device:** Surface Pro 6
*   **Key Roles and Configuration:**
    *   **Centralized Monitoring Interface:**
        *   Provides remote desktop access.
        *   Runs Grafana dashboards to visualize Kubernetes POD metrics, system logs, and overall system health.

## 3. Software and Infrastructure Components

**Container Orchestration and Infrastructure as Code**

*   **K3s Cluster:**
    *   **Control Plane:** Hosted on WSL2 (on the Beelink) with Flannel for networking.
    *   **Worker Nodes:** Include the Jetson for AI/ML workloads and any additional nodes as needed.
*   **Pulumi:**
    *   Defines the entire Kubernetes architecture, including deployments, services, and ingress configurations.
    *   Deploys Helm charts (e.g., Traefik) and integrates with Kubernetes resources.

**Ingress, Routing, and Application Deployment**

*   **Traefik Ingress Controller:**
    *   Routes external traffic.
    *   Handles SSL termination (with Let’s Encrypt integration) and manages gRPC traffic via proper annotations.
*   **Application Deployments:**
    *   Each service (e.g., Authelia, Heimdall, Guacamole, etc.) is defined and deployed as a Kubernetes resource.
    *   Kubernetes labels and node selectors are used to direct specific workloads to nodes fitted for them (e.g., GPU jobs to the Jetson).

**Logging, Monitoring, and Metrics**

*   **Centralized Logging:**
    *   Loki aggregates logs from all nodes.
    *   Promtail collects and forwards logs from each host.
*   **Metrics & Dashboarding:**
    *   Prometheus and OpenTelemetry collect metrics.
    *   Grafana (running on the Surface Pro 6) displays real-time performance data and alerts.

## 4. Networking, DNS, and Security

**Primary Local DNS Server**

*   **Device:** GL.i.Net AX1800 (Flint) Router running OpenWRT with AdGuard Home.
*   Overrides DNS settings across the local network.
*   Manages static DNS mappings (e.g., authelia.home.local, heimdall.home.local) pointing to the services exposed via Traefik.
*   Integrates with Tailscale for remote connections across a defined subnet.

**Backup DNS and Automated Recovery Procedures**

*   **Backup DNS Service:**
    *   Deploy a secondary DNS server (such as a containerized instance of Pi-hole or a backup AdGuard Home) on an independent node or within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **DHCP Configuration:** Distribute both primary (router) and secondary DNS server IPs to clients to ensure automatic fallback.
*   **Health Monitoring and Automated Failover:**
    *   Implement monitoring (using Prometheus Alertmanager or custom scripts) to regularly check the health and response of the primary DNS.
    *   Use Ansible playbooks to execute automated recovery steps—such as reapplying a known-good configuration, restarting DNS services, or switching the DHCP settings—to minimize downtime.

**Security Measures**

*   **Access and Identity:**
    *   Authelia for robust authentication and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) defined within Kubernetes.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   VaultWarden for secure storage of sensitive data.
*   **SSL and TLS:**
    *   Traefik is configured for SSL termination with automated certificate management via Let’s Encrypt.
*   **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Consider microsegmentation (using Kubernetes Network Policies) to restrict access between different services.
*   **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    *   Use Ansible to schedule and automate regular OS and application updates.
    *   Establish CI/CD pipelines to rebuild and redeploy container images as new patches are released.

## 5. Automation and Self-Maintenance

**Ansible-Based Automation**

*   **Configuration Management and Patching:**
    *   Playbooks manage the installation, configuration, and periodic updates across all nodes (e.g., k3s worker installations, software patches on Beelink and Jetson).
    *   Scheduled playbooks (triggered via cron jobs or an automation tool like Ansible Tower/AWX) ensure that security patches and updates are applied regularly.
*   **Self-Updating Mechanisms:**
    *   Store all Ansible playbooks in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git).
    *   Set up an automated process (such as a CI/CD pipeline) to pull the latest playbooks periodically before execution.
    *   Perform automated testing in staging to validate playbook changes before deploying them to production.
    *   Implement a controlled “self-update” strategy to update parts of the Ansible framework while ensuring a human review step to prevent disruptions.

**Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**

*   **Declarative Configuration:**
    *   Define all Kubernetes resources in Pulumi (Deployments, Services, Ingresses, Persistent Volumes, etc.) for reproducibility.
*   **Resource Management:**
    *   Specify resource requests and limits for all containers to ensure stable operation.
*   **Persistent Storage:**
    *   Use persistent volumes for crucial data (databases, secrets, logs) to ensure data integrity during failures or reboots.
*   **Version Control & Testing:**
    *   Maintain Pulumi and Ansible code in Git repositories.
    *   Integrate automated testing or staging environments to validate changes before applying them to the live environment.

## 6. Scalability and High Availability

*   **Service Redundancy:**
    *   Backup DNS service ensures continued name resolution in case of primary router failure.
    *   Kubernetes self-healing capabilities ensure that failed containers or pods are restarted automatically.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**
    *   Automated recovery procedures via Ansible minimize downtime.
    *   Multiple nodes (with distinct roles) distribute workload and reduce single points of
